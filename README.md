Python | Decision tree implementation

Decision Tree is one of the most powerful and popular algorithms. Python Decision-tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning algorithms. It works for both continuous as well as categorical output variables. In this article, We are going to implement a Decision tree in Python algorithm on the Balance Scale Weight & Distance Database presented on the UCI.
Decision Tree
A Decision tree is a tree-like structure that represents a set of decisions and their possible consequences. Each node in the tree represents a decision, and each branch represents an outcome of that decision. The leaves of the tree represent the final decisions or predictions.

Decision trees are created by recursively partitioning the data into smaller and smaller subsets. At each partition, the data is split based on a specific feature, and the split is made in a way that maximizes the information gain.
